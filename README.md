4 floppy disks

## puzzles
- Look into [Smart Scale](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Smart-Scale-With-Alarm-Clock-with-Wi-Fi-ESP826/) project for Indiana Jones like puzzle. Add RGB LEDs to the edge of the scale. If the floppy disks are removed they start to glow red and an alarm is triggered. STASIS tells you to put the prototype back. Find 4 different floppy disks in the lab or something with similar weight. The closer the weight placed on the scale is to the floppy disks the greener the LEDs get. If the weight matches the alarm is turned off and STASIS thanks you.

- The terminal has 1 or 4 floppy readers and you have to find out the right order of the disks:
Rearrange an ascii picture by inserting different floppy disks which trigger different image shifts etc. Help note beside the PC.
