## Tricking STASIS
To get the 4 floppy disks (e.g. the prototype) out of the safe, you have to replace them with 4 different floppy disks, that can be found in the room. If you remove the prototype disks without replacing them, STASIS is very angry and you can't solve the puzzle 'Reading the prototype'.
### Hints
1. Have you watched Indiana Jones? Maybe a famous scene inspires you.
2. Can you see more floppy disks outside the safe?
3. Try to replace the floppy disks inside the safte.

## Reading the prototype
To read the data from the prototype you have to reassemble an image. The image shifts depending on which disk is inserted into which reader. The colors of the disks match the part of the image that is changed. One reader shifts the position of the matching colored part, the other rotates the matching colored parts themselves.

### Hints
1. Be patient, watch closely and reassemble the image
2. You need all four floppy disks
3. The floppy disk colors match the image colors
