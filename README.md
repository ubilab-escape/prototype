4 floppy disks

## puzzles
- Look into [Smart Scale](https://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Smart-Scale-With-Alarm-Clock-with-Wi-Fi-ESP826/) project for Indiana Jones like puzzle. Add RGB LEDs to the edge of the scale. If the floppy disks are removed they start to glow red. The closer the weight paced on the scale is to the floppy disks the greener the LEDs get. Find 4 different floppy disks in the lab or something with similar weight.

- The terminal has 1 or 4 floppy readers and you have to find out the right order of the disks:
Rearrange an ascii picture by inserting different floppy disks which trigger different image shifts etc. Help note beside the PC.
